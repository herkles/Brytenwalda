# Feudal Tapestry - A western Europe Overhaul

Feudal Tapestry is a western european overhaul mod focusing on improving the historical flavor of Western Europe. From cultures to events to activities to titles, I hope to try and make Western Europe more flavorful and better.

If you find any bugs or issues do let me know and I will try to fix them to the best of my ability. If you have ideas or suggestions for improvement do let me know, as I welcome all feedback provided that it is constructive feedback.

Feel free to use my work in your mods - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up.

## Latest Version: 1.0.0 "Brytenwalda" (Released 07/06/2023)

This is the first release and focuses on the British Isles. The name Brytenwalda means britian rule or possibly wide ruler. The focus here is on improving the content for both 1066 and 867. It isn't strictly an England flavor mod, even if that gets the lion share of content.

as a side note: originally the mod was going to be called Brytenwalda and just be a british isle mod, but I decided to change the name and focus on a grander scope due to how intertwined the realms of Western Europe where with one another.

## Main Features

- revised cultural set up for the British Isles for both 867 and 1066
- the Heptarchy is a thing in 867
- different duchies for the anglo-saxons and norman adminstration
- Cultural evolution of English and Scottish cultures happen later
- the lands of the british isles use localized names for their lands
- Ireland is Catholic not Insular
- Different de jure set up in 867 and 1066
- Narrative events for William the conquer's conquest
- A bookmark where William the conquer is king(december 25th 1066)
