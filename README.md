# Feudal Tapestry - An Europe Overhaul

Feudal Tapestry is a european overhaul mod focusing on improving the historical flavor of Europe. From cultures to events to activities to titles, I hope to try and make Europe more flavorful and better.

If you find any bugs or issues do let me know and I will try to fix them to the best of my ability. If you have ideas or suggestions for improvement do let me know, as I welcome all feedback provided that it is constructive feedback.

Feel free to use my work in your mods - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up.

## Latest Version: 3.1.0 "Heresy" (Released 15/09/2024)

 A smaller update that adds some flavor for Christianity. Pregnant characters can make a vow to the Virgin Mary, as well as laying in and churching after the baby is born. Confirmation and other various flavor events have been added. 

 A number of Christian Heresies are able to hold church councils to determine various natures and doctrines of the Church. They also have a decision to translate the bible into a local language.
