# Treaty of Meerssen
#######################################
  tapestry_frankish.021.t:0 "Partioning Lothair's realm?"
  tapestry_frankish.021.desc:0 "A messenger from the court of Charles of western Francia has informed you that Lothair of Lotharingia has died. As such it would be in the interest of Francia as a whole to partion the lands between you and him. Louis the Younger ruling in Italy however is likely to be furious, but the benefits for East Francia could be quite good. Shall you go to Meerssen and sign the treaty?"
  tapestry_frankish.021.a:1 "Sign the Treaty!"
  tapestry_frankish.021.b:1 "Don't sign the Treaty!"

  tapestry_frankish.022.t:0 "The Treaty of Meerssen is signed"
  tapestry_frankish.022.desc:0 "Ludwig the German has agreed to sign the treaty. Lothair II realm is now partitioned between east and west francia. How long the treaty will hold, only God knows."
  tapestry_frankish.022.a:1 "God bless Francia!"

  tapestry_frankish.023.t:0 "Ludwig the German refuses"
  tapestry_frankish.023.desc:0 "Ludwig the German has refused to sign the treaty, allowing Louis of Italy to take full control of Lothar's possessions. This could be complicated for your ambitions. "
  tapestry_frankish.023.a:1 "Damn him!"
