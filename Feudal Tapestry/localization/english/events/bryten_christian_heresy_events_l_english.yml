It has gone back and forth, but with this bull and the support of many within the church, we have finally achieved victory in our struggle for Apostolic Poverty."

Unsurprisingly two factions have emerged from this, a more radical view that we should utterly cut off from the teachings of Rome. This horrified many others who believe that is heresy and our position is not one of heresy, but of right action that follows the teachings of the Church Fathers. Due to your influence, you are able to push the council towards one side or another."
