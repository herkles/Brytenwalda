  bryten_norse.001.t:0 "Dealing with a Heathen Sacred Grove"
  bryten_norse.001.desc:0 "Within your land lies a heathen grove, dedicated to heathen gods and goddesses. As a good christian, you should do something about it. Some of the more zealous members of the court suggest burning it down. Cleanse the area with holy exorcisms and fire. Some suggest that the better idea might be to reconsecrate it as a small church or abbey.  Another set of courtiers suggest that you just leave it alone. After all the power of the heathen gods pales in comparison to that of the True God./n/nWhat shall you do?"

# Way of Saint Olaf

 bryten_norse.010.t:0 "Supporting the Way of Saint Andrew"
 bryten_norse.010.desc.intro:0 "Every day, [christian.GetAdjective] pilgrims trek across the territories I rule to reach the Nidaros Cathedral where relics of Saint Olaf are held. Traveling can be dangerous, however, as there are constant dangers from bandits, wild animals, bad weather, or even just poor road conditions."
 bryten_norse.010.desc.christian:0 "\n\nTherefore, as a [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetReligion.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], it is my duty to assist these pilgrims - including those originating from my lands - on their journey. After all, I am sure that Saint Olaf himself would approve of any kind of aid I can lend to his devotees."
 bryten_norse.010.desc.non_christian:0 "\n\nSome [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdherentNamePlural] feel I do not owe anything to my [christian.GetAdjective] subjects, nor to the foreign [christian.GetAdjective] pilgrims. Still, I want to be seen as a just and tolerant ruler, improve relations with my realm’s [christian.GetAdjective] community, and facilitate the flow of trade."
 bryten_norse.010.desc.conclusion:0 "\n\nI have therefore set aside money to be spent on various infrastructure projects along the major pilgrimage routes leading to Nidaros in my realm, ranging from improving road conditions to constructing hostels and more. This will all ensure a safer, more comfortable journey for the pilgrims."
 bryten_norse.010.a:0 "It’s the least I can do."

  bryten_norse.020.desc:0 "For over a century now, the Nordic people have had this vikingr spirit to sail the water and go out and see the world. A wanderlust filled with trade, joy, pillage, and building new homes. However times are a changing and the various people of the North are settling down, preferring their towns and villages to going out a raiding as they did in ages past. "

  bryten_norse.050.t:0 "an Offering for [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.WarGodName]?"
  bryten_norse.050.desc:0 "If I wish for success in battle, it would make sense for me to appeal to the gods to do so. Several [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] have told me a good way of doing that is to take some expensive, beautiful equipment, like a masterfully carved shield and helmet, and toss them into a large lake or river in a ceremony. This will surely please [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.WarGodName]!"
  bryten_norse.050.a:1 "A good idea! Let's do that."
  bryten_norse.050.b:1 "I don't think I can afford it."

  bryten_norse.052.desc:0 "While traveling along a small, old dirt road, I pass by a tiny shrine dedicated to a healing goddess, Eir. I observe the statue of her which stands atop the small altar. We do not know who made this rudimentary shrine, as there are no inscriptions, but perhaps it was one of the locals living nearby who was a devotee of this goddess."
  bryten_norse.052.a:1 "I pray to Eir and then move on."

  bryten_norse.053.t:0 "Offering to Frigg" 
  bryten_norse.053.desc:0 "A couple traveling [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] told me that if I wanted to ensure good health and tranquility within my home, I should make an offering to Frigg, the wife of Odin. Lady Frigg as the divine queen watches the home and hearth. An offering to her would be good, the question is how big of an offering?"
  bryten_norse.053.a:1 "I can not offer to the Goddess right now."
  bryten_norse.053.b:1 "Let's make that small offering to Frigg."
  bryten_norse.053.c:1 "Add some fruits to my offering to Frigg."
  bryten_norse.053.d:1 "Give Frigg lots of fruits, coins, and jewelry!"

  bryten_norse.054.desc:0 "More and more of my soldiers are following this Christ, this white christ, as a bringer of victory and peace. Christ is a popular god throughout the world especially in the rest of Europe. Maybe I should give some offerings to this Christ for victory in battle?"
  bryten_norse.054.a:1 "Let me give some offerings to Christ as well"

  bryten_norse.056.desc:0 "While walking outside one day, I and a few of my guards come across a large pile of Apples.

  bryten_norse.056.a:1 "If you say so!"

  bryten_norse.057.t:0 "Eye Irritation"
  bryten_norse.057.desc:0 "I am suffering from some odd irritation in my eye. It doesn't seem like a serious affliction, but it is annoying. If I want to make it better, perhaps I should pray to Odin. It is said he has the power to cure any ailment of the eye, even minor ones like this."
  bryten_norse.057.a:1 "No, this is not a major issue."
  bryten_norse.057.b:1 "I will offer him fruits and cake."
  bryten_norse.057.tooltip:0 "Hopefully, your offering will #P please Odin#!, and he will help resolve your eye irritation."

  bryten_norse.058.desc:0 "I am at a nearby village and meeting with some of the local leaders. Some of them are telling me about the local folklore.\n\nA well-known story is that once, the settlement was beset by an army of bandits. The defending guards were losing morale, because it looked hopeless. Then, suddenly, everyone saw a manifestation of Thor, thundering in the sky!\n\nAs it looked like this great deity was defending the city from the air, this was a source of great encouragement to the guards, who were able to turn the tide of battle and force the bandits to retreat. For many years afterwards, the village was never bothered by bandits."
  bryten_norse.058.a:1 "An interesting tale, but is it really true?"
  bryten_norse.058.b:1 "This is a village blessed by Thor! Amazing!"

  bryten_norse.059.t:0 "An offering for the Land Wights"
  bryten_norse.059.desc:0 "Today I am dedicating a small altar out in nature, alongside a small stream, to the local land spirits. The various spirits of the land who watch and protect over the area. While not as powerful as the mighty Aesir or Vanir, the land wights are closer, and tied to this land and should be given proper respect just as well."
  bryten_norse.059.a:1 "I hope they will provide me with many blessings!"

  bryten_norse.060.t:0 "Dream of the Sea"
  bryten_norse.060.desc:0 "I saw the deity Aegir, god of the sea, in a dream. I took this as a good sign, so I ordered a craftsman to make me a small carving of a boat, which I buried on the grounds of my property as a sign of thanks."
  bryten_norse.060.a:1 "It was a good dream!"

  bryten_norse.061.t:0 "Frey and Horses"
  bryten_norse.061.desc:0 "I have come across a small shrine dedicated to Frey out in the wilderness on my travels.

  bryten_norse.062.desc:0 "An acquaintance has gifted me a medium-sized statue of the god Thor and Sif to place as decor in my private rooms.\n\nThe wooden statue of Thor depicts him in the traditional manner, wielding his famous hammer Mjolnir. While his consort Sif holds a cup in one hand and wheat in the other. \n\nTogether, they will surely bring prosperity into my household!""

  bryten_norse.063.desc:0 "A nearby village managed to hunt a great boar. Afterwards, a great feast was held, which I attended given I am the liege of this region. It was a lovely feast, and when we were all done with the feast, the bones of the boar was cremated and its ashes buried nearby in the traditional [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] manner.\n\nBoars are sacred animals of the gods, especially Freyr, and good sacrifices of these creatures are said to confer many blessings on worthy hunters and warriors."

  bryten_norse.064.desc:0 "here is a lone tree not too far from my house, which a number of [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] say is clearly a sacred tree, where dwells a number of spirits. Such trees, when found by followers of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] way, are to be venerated and given regular offerings. It is a beautiful tree, and probably an old one too, judging by its majestic size."
  bryten_norse.064.a:1 "Very well, I will perform regular offerings as needed."
  bryten_norse.064.b:1 "I should build a small altar around the tree to honor it!"
