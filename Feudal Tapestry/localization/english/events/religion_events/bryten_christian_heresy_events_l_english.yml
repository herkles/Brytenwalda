  bryten_heresy.002.desc:0 "Recently, the Christian community in the Balkans has been in an uproar thanks to the teachings of a charismatic preacher named Bogomil. Bogomil's preaching against the wealth of the Church and Nobility has attracted a lot of commoners. His teachings go against the teachings of the Holy Church believing in a dualistic cosmology, drawing on teachings from other gnostic heretics. \n\nMany ecclesiastical authorities condemn these heretical teachings, as do numerous nobles. Though a few say they are exagerating this movement and should focus on other things."

The first is a Monarchianist doctrine of christology, a more nuanced position on dualism. /n/nThe second position focuses much more on the dualistic nature of the world. Jesus came to free us from Satanail who rules the world, a force of pure evil./n/nA third faction focuses on a form of modalism that is easier to digest to the many faithful who believe themselves to be trinitarians.
