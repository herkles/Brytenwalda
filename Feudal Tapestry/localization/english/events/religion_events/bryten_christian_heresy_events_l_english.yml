  bryten_heresy.002.desc:0 "Recently, the Christian community in the Balkans has been in an uproar thanks to the teachings of a charismatic preacher named Bogomil. Bogomil's preaching against the wealth of the Church and Nobility has attracted a lot of commoners. His teachings go against the teachings of the Holy Church believing in a dualistic cosmology, drawing on teachings from other gnostic heretics. \n\nMany ecclesiastical authorities condemn these heretical teachings, as do numerous nobles. Though a few say they are exagerating this movement and should focus on other things."

  bryten_heresy.201.desc:0 "Recently, the Christian community has been in an uproar thanks to the teachings of a charismatic preacher named Peter of Bruys. Peter and his followers are iconoclasts destroying holy imagery and most infamously holding bonfires where they burn the cross. Further they denounce the Church's teachings, including among other things the baptism of infants. \n\nMany ecclesiastical authorities condemn these heretical teachings, as do numerous nobles. Though a few say they are exaggerating this movement and should focus on other more important spiritual matters."
