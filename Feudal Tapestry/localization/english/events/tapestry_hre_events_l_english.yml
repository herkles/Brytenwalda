# Otto the Great Events
#######################################
  tapestry_hre.001.t:0 "The Traitor in Lorraine"
  tapestry_hre.001.desc:0 "The traitorous Duke Giselbert of Lorraine left our service after the death of our esteemed father King Henry. Now they have turned to the protection of the Karlings in West Francia, asking them for aid against us.\n\nNot only have they forsaken their ancient service to our rule, but our spies tells us Gilbert has been conspiring with traitorous lords of the realm. The insult is too much to bear at this point, and it is about time we took back what is rightfully ours"
  tapestry_hre.001.war:1 "Lorraine is not to be held by the Karlings nor their vassals."
  tapestry_hre.001.no_war:1 "We will honor our part of the pact."

  tapestry_hre.002.t:0 "Attacking Saxons"
  tapestry_hre.002.desc:0 "Reports from our scouts in the east confirms our suspicions, Otto is preparing for an attack on our lands. Long has the king of the Saxons sought for a justifiable reason to try and force Lorraine back under his sovereignty, but now it seems he has thrown caution to the wind.\n\nIt is time to gather our men and protect ourselves. Lorraine is ours, and we will make sure the Saxons pay dearly for every step they take into it."
  tapestry_hre.002.a:1 "They will not pass into our lands unopposed."

  tapestry_hre.003.t:0 "A Rebellious Brother"
  tapestry_hre.003.desc:0 "My younger brother Otto has been a thorn in my side from a young age, and it only escalated after he was made primary heir to our father Heinrich. He has repeatedly withheld titles that should be rightfully mine, and given them away to others instead.\n\nFrom my correspondence with the other lords of the realm, it is clear I am not the only one who feels slighted by my tyrannical sibling. Particularly the lords of Franconia and East Frisia are sure to join me, if I am to make a declaration of war upon Otto."
  tapestry_hre.003.rebel:1 "Time to take my rightful place as the heir of Heinrich."
  tapestry_hre.003.no_rebel:1 "I do not have the men or followers for such a war."

  tapestry_hre.004.t:0 "Thankmar's Rebellion"
  tapestry_hre.004.desc:0 "The elder bastard of Heinrich, Thankmar, have declared war upon our liege, his younger brother Otto. It has been obvious to most that the man has felt slighted by his sibling for quite a while now, and it comes as no surprise when one of his messengers arrive in [Root.Capital.GetName].\n\nAfter a long and tiring speech, the messenger finally asks if we can bring word back to his lord that we will join the rebellion. Though we have never particularly cared for Otto either, it all seems a bit much. Though it is a good chance to lessen the authority of the Saxon Kings."
  tapestry_hre.004.rebel:1 "Yes, bring back word we will march upon Otto immediately."
  tapestry_hre.004.no_rebel:1 "No, we have no interest in your petty little war."

  tapestry_hre.005.t:0 "Thankmar's Rebellion"
  tapestry_hre.005.desc:0 "It seems my beloved older brother Thankmar has raised an army to topple my rule over the Germans. Though a surprise to everyone at court, the man has always had an ambitious streak.\n\nAfter a couple of minutes to process all of it, I give the order to prepare our troops to fight our fellow Saxons. It is a tragedy that it has come to this, but it seems like there is no other choice.\n\nLet us just hope there will not be more lords flocking to his cause."
  tapestry_hre.005.a:1 "You too, Thankmar?"

  tapestry_hre.006.t:0 "Thankmar's Victory"
  tapestry_hre.006.desc:0 "After a long and tiresome war, our victory has finally been ensured, as Otto is brought to me in chains. He looks tired and saddened by all of it, but I will not let him spoil the celebrations.\n\nThe lords now look to me for guidance, as the new king of the Germans. Lately, however, I have felt like it might be time to put an end to the Saxon rule over foreign lands. Maybe it is time to return to time of old, before the Carolingians and Merohingians gathered all the Germans under one rule."
  tapestry_hre.006.legacy:1 "I will continue my father's legacy."
  tapestry_hre.006.old_ways:1 "It is time to return to the old ways."
  tapestry_hre.006.old_ways.tt:0 "The old germanic kingdoms shall be restored. Restoring the HRE by the Germans will no longer be possible."

  tapestry_hre.007.t:0 "A Return to the Old Ways"
  tapestry_hre.007.desc:0 "After crushing the armies of his brother Otto, King Thankmar of the Germans has declared that the tribes of old will once more be ruled by their own. No longer will a Saxon King rule over foreign people.\n\nUnmaking the centuries of authority built up by the Carolingians, Merohingians and even those of his own family, he has simply let go off the old bonds binding the dukes of the southern lands to himself.\n\nFranconia, Swabia, Thuringia and Bavaria now look to their own lords to rule them in these uncertain times. It is said the legacy of Charlemagne has been buried for good."
  tapestry_hre.007.a:1 "interesting"

  tapestry_hre.008.t:0 "Otto's Victory"
  tapestry_hre.008.desc:0 "I look at Thankmar, as he is brought to me in chains. My once great older brother looks haggard and tired as he stands in front of me. I finally ask the guards to take him away, for now.\n\nNo celebrations will be had, as this has been nothing but a tragedy for all of us. Though it was an appalling end, it was most likely the only conclusion we could have to this conflict.\n\nWith the problematic lords of the realm quelled, it is time to look towards the future."
  tapestry_hre.008.a:1 "There is still a lot to be done."

  tapestry_hre.009.t:0 "The Kingdom of Italy"
  tapestry_hre.009.desc:0 "Under the horrendous leadership of [italian_king.GetTitledFirstName], Italy has become a shadow of what it once was. The great legacy of the Romans and their descendants have been shattered by the civil wars and the chaos of the last decades.\n\nNow many of the minor Italian lords under his leadership have sent us emissaries asking for aid. They supposedly miss the days when they were under our distant rule. If we want to raise the banners of Charlemagne once more, the Kingdom of Italy will be essential in securing our recognition as true descendants of his empire."
  tapestry_hre.009.war:1 "Prepare our men, Italy will be secured for the good of all."
  tapestry_hre.009.no_war:1 "We have no interest in this region, leave them to their petty infighting."


  tapestry_hre.010.t:0 "Invasion of Otto"
  tapestry_hre.010.desc:0 "The King of the Germans to our north, Otto, have declared war upon us. He loudly claim it is for the best of the Italian people, and pretends that he is liberating Italy from the rule of [italian_king.GetTitledName].\n\nThe Germans are preparing to pass through the Alps, and put an end to the chaos that has embroiled Italy once and for all. Who will stand against them and treat them like invaders, and who will embrace them like old neighbors and friends?"
  tapestry_hre.010.a:1 "Let them come!"
