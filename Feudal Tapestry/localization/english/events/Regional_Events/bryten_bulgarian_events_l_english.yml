  bryten_bulgaria.001.t:0 "The Bulgarian Tsar"
  bryten_bulgaria.001.desc:0 "When Simeon declared himself Tsar of the Bulgarians and the Romans, he brought a conflict to bear with the Romans. Following our victory in 927 our patriarch has been recognized and the Romans are paying us tribute. However we did have to officially give up claims to being Tsar of the Romans, however many who fought with Simeon are ready to draw their swords to take the city of the world's desire. For now though we must abide by the peace treaty we signed with the romans."
  bryten_bulgaria.001.a:1 "Long Live the tsar."

  bryten_bulgaria.002.t:0 "The Bulgarians at our Gates"
  bryten_bulgaria.002.desc:0 "A great barbaric means is at our gates called the Bulgarians. They have dared to claim that they are a universal ruler, like we are, and worse they have openly called themselves Tsar of the Bulgarians and the Romans. As if a barbarian can be the ruler of a roman. The last war with them was a costly one and so a truce has been signed, but we bide our time to remind them their place."
  bryten_bulgaria.002.a:1 "Rome shall not bow to barbarians"

  bryten_bulgaria.003.desc:0 "We have finally achieved the dream of Simeon and have taken the city of the world's desire. The Romans have considered us barbarians, savages, but now we are in the great city. As the smoke and flames die down, it is time for you to decide what shall be done. "
  bryten_bulgaria.003.a:1 "I am the Tsar of the Romans and Bulgarians"

Will anything make them leave? Anything short of our utter destruction...?"
