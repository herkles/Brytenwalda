  bryten_bulgaria.001.desc:0 "When Simeon declared himself Tsar of the Bulgarians and the Romans, he brought a conflict to bear with the Romans. Following our victory in 927 our patriarch has been recognized and the Romans are paying us tribute. However we did have to officially give up claims to being Tsar of the Romans, however many who fought with Simeon are ready to draw their swords to take the city of the world's desire. For now though we must abide by the peace treaty we signed with the romans."

As if a barbarian can be the ruler of a roman. The last war with them was a costly one and so a truce has been signed, but we bide our time to remind them their place."
