  bryten_scotland.002.desc:1 "Though we share common origins with the other Anglo-Saxons, our clans living in the lowlands of northern Britain have begun diverging culturally and linguistically as we adapt to life in the rugged terrain.\n\nMany of our people are now clamoring for a unique cultural identity we can call ours. Something we can be proud of being..."
  bryten_scotland.002.a:0 "We are Scotsmen, now and forever!"
  bryten_scotland.002.b:0 "We shouldn't turn our backs on our countrymen."

# Supporting the Way of St Andrew

 bryten_scotland.010.t:0 "Supporting the Way of Saint Andrew"
 bryten_scotland.010.desc.intro:0 "Every day, [christian.GetAdjective] pilgrims trek across the territories I rule to reach the cathedral of St. Andrew where relics of Saint Andrew are held. Traveling can be dangerous, however, as there are constant dangers from bandits, wild animals, bad weather, or even just poor road conditions."
 bryten_scotland.010.desc.christian:0 "\n\nTherefore, as a [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetReligion.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], it is my duty to assist these pilgrims - including those originating from my lands - on their journey. After all, I am sure that Saint Andrew himself would approve of any kind of aid I can lend to his devotees."
 bryten_scotland.010.desc.non_christian:0 "\n\nSome [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdherentNamePlural] feel I do not owe anything to my [christian.GetAdjective] subjects, nor to the foreign [christian.GetAdjective] pilgrims. Still, I want to be seen as a just and tolerant ruler, improve relations with my realm’s [christian.GetAdjective] community, and facilitate the flow of trade."
 bryten_scotland.010.desc.conclusion:0 "\n\nI have therefore set aside money to be spent on various infrastructure projects along the major pilgrimage routes leading to St. Andrew in my realm, ranging from improving road conditions to constructing hostels and more. This will all ensure a safer, more comfortable journey for the pilgrims."
 bryten_scotland.010.a:0 "It’s the least I can do."
