  bryten_norse.001.desc:0 "Within your land lies a heathen grove, dedicated to heathen gods and goddesses. As a good christian, you should do something about it. Some of the more zealous members of the court suggest burning it down. Cleanse the area with holy exorcisms and fire. Some suggest that the better idea might be to reconsecrate it as a small church or abbey.  Another set of courtiers suggest that you just leave it alone. After all the power of the heathen gods pales in comparison to that of the True God./n/nWhat shall you do?"

# Way of Saint Olaf

 bryten_norse.010.t:0 "Supporting the Way of Saint Andrew"
 bryten_norse.010.desc.intro:0 "Every day, [christian.GetAdjective] pilgrims trek across the territories I rule to reach the Nidaros Cathedral where relics of Saint Olaf are held. Traveling can be dangerous, however, as there are constant dangers from bandits, wild animals, bad weather, or even just poor road conditions."
 bryten_norse.010.desc.christian:0 "\n\nTherefore, as a [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetReligion.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], it is my duty to assist these pilgrims - including those originating from my lands - on their journey. After all, I am sure that Saint Olaf himself would approve of any kind of aid I can lend to his devotees."
 bryten_norse.010.desc.non_christian:0 "\n\nSome [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdherentNamePlural] feel I do not owe anything to my [christian.GetAdjective] subjects, nor to the foreign [christian.GetAdjective] pilgrims. Still, I want to be seen as a just and tolerant ruler, improve relations with my realm’s [christian.GetAdjective] community, and facilitate the flow of trade."
 bryten_norse.010.desc.conclusion:0 "\n\nI have therefore set aside money to be spent on various infrastructure projects along the major pilgrimage routes leading to Nidaros in my realm, ranging from improving road conditions to constructing hostels and more. This will all ensure a safer, more comfortable journey for the pilgrims."
