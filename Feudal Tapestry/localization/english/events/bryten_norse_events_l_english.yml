  bryten_norse.001.desc:0 "Within your land lies a heathen grove, dedicated to heathen gods and goddesses. As a good christian, you should do something about it. Some of the more zealous members of the court suggest burning it down. Cleanse the area with holy exorcisms and fire. Some suggest that the better idea might be to reconsecrate it as a small church or abbey.  Another set of courtiers suggest that you just leave it alone. After all the power of the heathen gods pales in comparison to that of the True God./n/nWhat shall you do?"
