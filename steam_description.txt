[h1]Feudal Tapestry - A western Europe Overhaul[/h1]

Feudal Tapestry is a western european overhaul mod focusing on improving the historical flavor of Western Europe. From cultures to events to activities to titles, I hope to try and make Western Europe more flavorful and better.

If you find any bugs or issues do let me know and I will try to fix them to the best of my ability. If you have ideas or suggestions for improvement do let me know, as I welcome all feedback provided that it is constructive feedback.

Feel free to use my work in your mods - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up.
